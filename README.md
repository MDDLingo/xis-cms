# XIS-CMS
Content Management Systems (CMS) are increasingly popular web application platforms used in multiple domains. CMS allow non-technical users to manage the content and features of websites with data-driven web modules, that abstract functionality without requiring any software programming knowledge. However, without the development of specific modules, a CMS usually cannot support more specific or complex scenarios. For that purpose, developers have to build custom modules using the CMS-specific language, which requires they must master the programming and technical skills. This is especially important when there is already a data repository in use on other applications and the CMS must manage or expose part of the information.
XIS-CMS is a Model-Driven Development approach to develop a CMS toolkit, containing a set of modules. XIS-CMS approach includes a domain-specific modeling language, defined as a UML profile, and a companion framework defined on top of Sparx Systems Enterprise Architect and Eclipse Modeling Framework technologies. Using the XIS-CMS, platform-independent models are defined to specify the CMS module and generate the corresponding source code, increasing productivity and portability when developing for multiple CMS platforms, facilitating migrations and give a more abstract vision to non-technical stakeholders. This research presents an evaluation of the XIS-CMS, based on case studies and user test sessions, discuss its results and compare it with other works in the same field of CMS.
